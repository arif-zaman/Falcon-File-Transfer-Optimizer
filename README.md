The application can only correctly function on Linux-based operating systems due to several Linux-based functional dependencies. There are two configuration files for specifying the source, destinations, maximum allowed thread, and many other options. 
    
Please use python3 and install necessary packages using the requirements.txt file, preferably in a virtual environment, to avoid package version conflicts. For GridFTP client optimization, please follow the link below.
